										<h3><a href="#">Attachment Theory</a></h3>
									</header>
									<p>
										The attachment theory that was originally founded by John Bowlby and Mary Ainsworth and its main focus is on infants’ need to seek proximity with caregiver especially when they’re threatened or upset. Bowlby proposed main points regarding the attachment theory, these included that the child should receive continuous care from primary caregiver and attachment figure. There are long-term negative consequences to being deprived of this care in early childhood, including depression, aggression, reduced intelligence and affectionless psychopathology. Furthermore, if a child were to be separated from their attachment figure for a short period of time, they would show signs of distress that would vary depending on how securely attached a child is to that attachment figure.
									</p>
									<p>
										Securely attached children are able to regulate their emotions when they are distressed and resilient even in the absence of their attachment figure. Insecurely- disorganized attached children are not as flexible in regulating their emotions as securely attached children are and they do not have the opportunity to learn the emotion regulation strategies they need to reduce their distress in difficult situations. Ambivalently attached children tend to exaggerate their display of negative emotion in order to get the attention of their attachment figure who is inconsistently available. Avoidantly attached children tend to hide or minimize their negative emotion when they are around their attachment figure.									</p>

										<h2><a href="#">The Parental Socialization Model </a></h2>
										<p>
											The parental socialization model proposes that parents’ emotion socialization behaviors (ESBs), which includes parents’ expression of emotion as well as their reaction to their children’s emotions, may directly influence a child’s emotional arousal and learning about emotions.
										</p>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/pic06.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>
										As shown in Figure 1, the four predictors on the left (child characteristics, parent characteristics, cultural factors, and context) can have a linear interaction and a direct relationship with emotion-related parenting practices. Child characteristics, like age or sex, may impact how parents talk about emotions with them. Parent characteristics like their sex, personality, emotion related beliefs, and their parenting style can also impact the way they talk to their children about emotions. Cultural factors can include gender stereotypes (ex. It may not be acceptable for boys to express sadness and for girls to express anger) and emotion-related norms and values (what emotions are acceptable to for children to express). Finally, context is important and the degree of the emotion expressed depending on the situation.
									</p>
									<p>
										The way a parent reacts to a child’s emotions and the way they discuss these emotions with their children (emotion-related parenting practices) then influences a child’s arousal. For example, if a parent responds with anger or frustration towards a child who wants to discuss how they feel, the child will learn that expressing emotions will lead to a negative consequence and will be less likely to share how they feel in the future. This then influences the child in different aspects including how the child experiences and expresses an emotion, how they understand an emotion and regulate it in specific contexts, and it also influences the child’s schema of themselves, their relationship with their parents and the world.
									</p>
									<p>
										There are multiple moderators that can also influence a child’s arousal along with the different parenting practices, and these include the intensity of the emotions (negative emotions tend to be more intense), child’s temperament and personality, and clarity of parents’ communication. Additionally, the child’s experience of the emotion and their ability to regulate it has an influence on their social behavior and social competence. That relationship can be reversed. Social competence or social behavior can influence the way a child is able to regulate their emotions.
									</p>
									<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/pic06.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>
										As it appears in Figure 2, parents’ behaviors can directly influence their child’s emotion regulation and similarly, a child’s behavior can influence a parent’s emotion regulation. For example if a child usually feels anxious on a morning of a test or a book report, they may behave differently on these morning by locking themselves in their rooms and refusing to go to school. This behavior can delay parents going to work, which might cause the parents to become frustrated or anxious themselves. Depending on how the parent regulates his or her own feelings of frustration, the situation may be dealt with in a variety of ways. If the child’s parent has competent regulation skills that allow him or her to provide warmth, support and guidance to the child (listen and validate feelings that child is having in regards to the test/book report), compared to a parent who reacts in an impulsive or harsh way (for example, yell out of frustration or anger since they are late), this will reduce the child’s anxiety experienced by the child in this situation and in similar situations in the future.  That being said, it is also important to recognize that parents have every right to feel frustrated by similar incidents, that’s why it is essential for parents to regulate their own emotions in order to accommodate their children’s emotions. It is also helpful for parents to have their own coping skills and regulations, to avoid expressing anger or frustration in a hurtful way in front of their children.

								<h3>What Can parents do?</h3>
							</header>
							<p>
									There are four ways through which parents’ emotion expressivity influences children’s emotional competence. The first way is highlighting the emotional significance of an event through their reactions, which is an example of social referencing, which develops in infancy. Through social referencing, an infant can learn how to react to novel objects or situations by using their parents’ reactions as reference. For example if a mother displays disgust to a novel object, the infant might express negative emotion to the object or avoid it. Social referencing is a skill and tool that develops in children during infancy however, it is still used by children as they grow older to help them understand more about the world. During ambiguous or novel situations, a child may get emotional cues from their parents, and these emotions can include fear, anger, happiness or disgust depending on the situation. The second way is how parents model behavioral, facial and verbal displays of a specific emotion. Third way is how parents show the common actions or behaviors required to cope with a specific emotion. These behaviors can vary depending on the context and the the parents’ and child’s personality. Finally, the fourth way is how parents help children acquire a unique emotional history through the overall affective environment that they expose their children to. Once a child learns the behaviors required to cope and how to express emotions in specific contexts, the child would develop a repertoire of regulation skills that they can use in different situations.										</p>
																			<p>
									Whether parents’ emotion expressivity is negative or positive, this will have an impact on a child’s emotional development. For example, if the parent constantly uses excessive negative emotion, this will dysregulate a child’s emotional functioning as compared to parents who express more positive affect, which results in children being more happy and display less dysregulated anger with family and peers. Not all positive emotional expressivity is necessarily healthy and not all negative emotional expressivity is necessarily unhealthy; it all depends on the circumstances and the goodness of fit (the appropriate emotion that needs to be displayed or expressed), as well as the nature of the social interaction. An example is if a child displays glee when his peer loses at a spelling bee, it would be important for a parent or a teacher to point out the negative implications this glee has on the peer’s self-image and how the child can modify his emotional response in similar situations in the future. Another example is a parent expressing sadness during a funeral, which would be a healthy model for a child (depending on his or her age) regarding the appropriate emotional response for this situation.
									</p>
									<p>
									 Parents provide contingencies for their children’s emotion management through punishment or reinforcement that help shape children’s future emotional behavior. Parents who respond to children’s emotions (positive and negative) in a warm and accepting manner, have children who are well regulated. In contrast, parents who minimize a child’s emotion or punish emotional display lead to the child learning that there are negative consequences to asking for help in alleviating negative emotional states. These non-supportive behaviors that parents display in response to children’s negative emotions can lead their children poorer emotion regulation, such as vagal withdrawal, meaning that the child is less likely to express how they feel to their parents. On the other hand, parents who encourage constructive action or the use of internal emotion regulation strategies have children who display a low intensity of anger, exhibit adaptive coping, and use verbal objections to deal with anger. </p>
									 <p>
									Finally, the content and frequency of parent-child emotion talk are related to how well the child is able to regulate their own emotions.These conversations between parents and children help the child learn to identify emotions, as well as regulating negative affect and learn culturally appropriate display rules of expression. There are some gender differences that have been identified in previous studies, including the use of more “emotion words” with daughters and having more frequent talks about emotions with daughters than with sons. Additionally, during conversations with sons, the parents talk more frequently about anger, whereas with daughters, parents talk more frequently about sadness. Researchers who have explored gender differences in parent-child emotion talks have concluded that through these discussions, girls learn that emotions are to be shared with others, while boys learn to externalize emotions in a specific way rather than talk about how they feel with others. Additionally, these differences in emotional expressions predict peer acceptance by other boys and girls. Boys tend to neutralize their negative emotions, which resulted in peers’ acceptance by both boys and girls. Girls on the other hand tend to substitute negative emotions for a positive one, which resulted in girls’ acceptance but not boys.
									</p>

									<p>It was recognized by Gottman et al., 1998 that parents can either be “emotion coaching” or “emotion dismissing”. Emotion coaching parents are aware of children’s emotions and are able to help their child label the emotion they are feeling verbally as well as problem solve with their child to help them find the most constructive way to manage emotions in a situation; they also believe that experiencing negative affect is healthy. Emotion dismissing[UoR11] parents are less aware of emotions that their children are feeling, they are unable to give their child adequate language to express or label how they are feeling, they believe that experiencing negative affect is harmful and finally, they attempt to alter their child’s emotion on their own rather than giving the child the coping skills they need to manage their own emotions (they do not give them an opportunity to learn emotion management skills).
