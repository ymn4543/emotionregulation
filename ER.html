										Emotion regulation is a multidimensional construct that includes clarity, awareness, and acceptance of emotions, as well as coming up with strategies to manage these emotions. A set of complex processes constitutes emotion regulation, and this includes monitoring, evaluating, and modifying emotional reactions in order to reach one’s goal. To monitor ones emotions, refers to the self-awareness and understanding of an emotional experience. The evaluating process refers to the interpretation of the circumstances that evoke a certain emotion for an individual. Finally, the modifying process refers to the access to adequate coping strategies that are helpful for regulating one’s emotions during a stressful event.

											<h3>Emotion regulation development in children</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
                  Emotion regulation consists of multiple processes and components. These components can be broken down into internal components(neurophysiological, cognitive, and subjective), behavioral components(facial expressions and actions), and external/ social components(cultural significance, social significance, and behavior of others). Children depend on previous social interactions to regulate their emotions; therefore, parents’ emotional expression and behavior have a strong impact on the development of emotion regulation in children.
<p>
  In infancy, a child exhibits the basic emotions, like anger, fear, and joy through[GA1] their facial expressions that are not associated with a specific incident. At 7 months, children begin to express fear in the presence of a stranger. Normally during infancy, social referencing starts to develop, which is when infants use others’ emotional expression as a guide when reacting to new situations. During later infancy (3-12 months) and toddlerhood (1-2 years), the expression of emotions starts to become connected to a specific event and these emotions serve the purpose of expressing how a child feels in response to that event. During this time, emotional development is focused on emotional expression that is an appropriate response to the event as well as language development that helps the child label their feelings. During toddlerhood, self-conscious emotions, such as shame, embarrassment, and pride start to develop. Toddlers are able to use language to self-regulate by talking themselves through emotionally challenging situations or using words to express their concern to an adult who might be able to help them in regulating their emotions.
<p>
  <p>
Preschoolers or children in elementary age start to develop a deeper understanding of emotions and have a larger repertoire of behavior to help them manage their emotions. Additionally, preschoolers have an understanding of display rules, which are culturally defined rules that guide a person’s emotional behavior depending on the social context. Some of the strategies that children learn at this age are the amplification of facial expression, minimization of an emotion, substitution of an expression, and neutralization  of emotional expression.
<p>
  <p>
 During middle childhood (6-12 years), children learn more about display rules and gender differences start to appear. Girls tend to use a substitution of emotion whereas boys tend to be better at neutralizing an emotion. Children are also able to recognize if their emotions are different from others’ emotions and may alter their emotional expression depending on the situation. Males are also more likely to suppress sadness while females are more likely to suppress anger. From middle childhood to adolescence, the self-conscious emotions that had already emerged earlier start to intensify and the frequency of these emotions may increase. Adolescents are more likely going to express their emotions when a supportive reaction is expected and they are more expected to alter their emotions with their mothers than with their fathers or peers. The development of emotion regulation may look different in children who have neurodevelopmental disorders, since this influences the way the brain functions (affecting the nervous system therefore affecting self-control, learning, and memory).
